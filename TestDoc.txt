The dimensions of Jay's room in centimeters are:

Length = 8m x 100 cm/m = 800 cm

Width = 4m x 100 cm/m = 400 cm

Next, we need to calculate the area of the room in square centimeters:

Area = Length x Width

Area = 800 cm x 400 cm

Area = 320,000 cm^2

Since each tile is 25 cm x 20 cm, the area of each tile is:

Area of each tile = 25 cm x 20 cm

Area of each tile = 500 cm^2

To find out how many tiles Jay needs to cover the floor of his room, we can divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile:

Number of tiles = Area of room / Area of each tile

Number of tiles = 320,000 cm^2 / 500 cm^2

Number of tiles = 640

Therefore, Jay will need 640 tiles to cover the floor of his room.
